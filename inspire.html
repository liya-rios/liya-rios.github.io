        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>content</p>
        <p>As someone who values advocacy and using art as a medium to spread awareness,<break>I find Sister Corita's ability to break artistic and societal barriers throughout the 20th century beyond inspiring.</p>
        <p>Her work was not only unique in style and medium, but encouraged conversations on the intersection<break> of race, poverty, and social injustice occurring throughout this time.</p>
        <p>I continue to think about the impact of Sister Corita's work and consider<break> how my own work can hold a similar influence on our world.</p>
