        <h2><em>An Inspiration to Artists & Activists Alike</em></h2>
        <p>As someone who values advocacy and using art as a medium to spread awareness, I find Sister Corita's ability to break artistic and societal barriers throughout the 20th century beyond inspiring.
            <br><br>Her work encouraged conversations on the intersection of race, poverty, and social injustice through use of bold colors, typography, and pop culture elements. This not only reflected Sister Corita's dedication to activism, but her remarkable talent for fusing social justice and creative expression. I continue to think about the impact of Sister Corita's work and consider the potential of my own to hold a similar influence on our world.</p>
