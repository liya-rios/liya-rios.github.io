        <h2><em>An Inspiration to Artists & Activists Alike</em></h2>
        <p>As someone who values advocacy and using art as a medium to spread awareness, I find Sister Corita's ability to break artistic and societal barriers <br><br>throughout the 20th century beyond inspiring. Her work encouraged conversations on the intersection of race, poverty, and social injustice <br><br>through use of bold colors, typography, and pop culture elements. This not only reflected Sister Corita's dedication to activism, but her remarkable talent <br><br>for fusing social justice and creative expression. I continue to think about the impact of Sister Corita's work and consider the potential of my own to hold a <br><br>similar influence on our world.</p>
