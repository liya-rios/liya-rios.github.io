        <h2><em>An Inspiration to Artists & Activists Alike</em></h2>
        <p>As someone who values advocacy and using art as a medium to spread awareness, I find Sister Corita's ability to break artistic                 and societal barriers throughout the 20th century beyond inspiring. <break></break>Her work incorporated bold colors, typography, and pop culture, and encouraged conversations on the intersection of <break></break>race, poverty, and social injustice. This not only reflected Sister Corita's dedication to activism, but her remarkable talent <break></break> for fusing social justice and creative expression. I continue to think about the impact of Sister Corita's work and consider <break></break>how my own work can hold a similar influence on our world.</p>
