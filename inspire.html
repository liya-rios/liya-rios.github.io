        <h2><em>An Inspiration to Artists & Activists Alike</em></h2>
        <p>As someone who values advocacy and using art as a medium to spread awareness, I find Sister Corita's ability to break artistic and societal barriers <br><br>throughout the 20th century beyond inspiring. Her work incorporated bold colors, typography, and pop culture, and encouraged conversations on the <br><br> intersection of race, poverty, and social injustice. This not only reflected Sister Corita's dedication to activism, but her remarkable talent for fusing <br><br>social justice and creative expression. I continue to think about the impact of Sister Corita's work and consider how my own work can hold a <br><br>similar influence on our world.</p>
