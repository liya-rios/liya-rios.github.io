        <h2><em>Graphic Design Student, Artist & Activist</em></h2>
        
        <p>I am currently studying <strong>graphic design</strong> with a minor in <strong>digital marketing</strong> at the University of Northern Colorado.<br>
            With my passion for social justice and environmentalism, I really focus on creating pieces that bring awareness <br>
            to current social issues in hopes of inspiring change and making a difference.<br>When I'm not in class or working on projects, I serve coffee to our community as a Dutch Bros "Broista".
