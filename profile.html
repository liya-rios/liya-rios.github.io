        <p>I am currently studying graphic design with a minor in digital marketing at the University of Northern Colorado. With my passion for social justice and environmentalism, I really focus on creating pieces that make a difference. When I'm not studying or in class, I work as a "broista" at Dutch Bros making and serving coffee to our community.</p>
