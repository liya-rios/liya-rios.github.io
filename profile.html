        <h2>Artist & Activist</h2>
        <p>I am currently studying graphic design with a minor in digital marketing at the University of Northern Colorado.<br>
            With my passion for social justice and environmentalism, I really focus on creating pieces that inspire change and make a difference.<br>
            When I'm not studying or in class, I work as a Dutch Bros "broista" serving coffee to our community.</p>
