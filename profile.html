        <h2>Graphic Design Student, Artist & Activist</h2>
        
        <p>I am currently studying graphic design with a minor in digital marketing at the University of Northern Colorado.<br>
            With my passion for social justice and environmentalism, I really focus on creating pieces that bring awareness <br>
            to current social issues in hopes of inspiring change and making a difference no matter how small. When I'm not in class <br>
            or working on projects, I serve coffee to our community as a Dutch Bros "broista".
